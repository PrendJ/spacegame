# Agent Guidelines

- Keep Flask endpoints minimal; prefer static assets for client logic.
- When editing frontend files, favor readable, well-commented code and avoid inline `<style>` or `<script>` blocks.
- Document gameplay changes in `docs/spec.md` and keep the README concise.
- Ensure accessibility labels remain present on interactive UI elements.
